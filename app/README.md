This is my first HTML/CSS website. I came up with an imaginary technology company as a topic.
My goal was to implement a website that is responsive on different devices. I first made the website suitable for a cellphone, and then I started to implement the changes that are required to make the website suitable for a computer screen. I believe I succeeded in these.
The most challenging part was getting the page to fit on a tablet screen after the previous implementations. I tried very hard to get the settings right for that as well, but it may be that I didn't quite succeed. So, that's the next challenge I need to solve next :)
